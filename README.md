# Installation

```
$ npm install
$ node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server
```

Then point your browser to the webpack dev server at http://localhost:8080/.

If you're doing API development as well, set your API endpoint in your
local config file at `config/local.yml`, for example:

    api_base: http://localhost:8000/v1
